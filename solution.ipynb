    "\n",
    "This document aims to provide answers to the Mighty Analyst Case provided by the team of MyTomorrows. It consists of 3 parts: \n",
    "- **Task 1:** Providing simple procedure statistics to a client\n",
    "- **Task 2:** Providing information to specific user groups\n",
    "- **Task 3:** Sharing information to senior management & other employees\n",
    "\n",
    "The Case description mentions 3 stages of maturity when it comes to the data architecture: Excel files (included in the case), a postgres database connected to Tableau, and finally dbt. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this solution we will exclude the following: \n",
    "- Setting up a dbt model, as it does require some configuration time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we will use the following setup: \n",
    "- We will mimic the current architecture by uploading all files to a Google BigQuery postgres database, to simulate the current ecosystem\n",
    "- This database will be used both in this notebook to create helper table, and in Tableau to create visualizations based on those helper tables\n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "There is quite some ambiguity in the question. We will decouple this question into multiple parts so that we can answer each element seperately: \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Part #1: Extending the report to other client\n",
    "Such dashboards can be very useful for clients to understand their data, and guide them more towards understandibiltiy of patients needs. It is therefore crucial that all clients are enabled to do so. \n",
    "In this particular case, I would rely on 2 options: \n",
    "- **Set up access-controlled folders in the Tableau server** This setup would rely on central datasources accesible by all, \n",
    "which are filtered at the data ingestion stage of the tableau dashboard creation. This would lower the maintenance efforts on the data structure side, as all changes would be direclty effective to all clients.\n",
    "- If more personalisation is needed for specific clients, we could **Set up parameterized data models in dbt or SQL**. This option would deduplicate the logic for backend tables per client, enabling custom logics and clearer boundaries of data storage. I would however advise using this setup in niche needs of clients, as the maintenance costs on both data modeling (dbt) and data visualization (tableau) would be high.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Part #2: Information on Hospital specific data\n",
    "The current dataset contains only one organization or hospital: the Massachusetts General Hospital. It is included as being part of the filters on which one can filter on in the dashboard provided at Task #1. We could envision having more specific information available on hospital level. One option we can already do is to enable the dashboard user to select the level of detail they are interested in. That is why a parameter `Level of Detail` was introduced in the dashboard shared in Task #1, enabling users to select on which granularity the different metrics are needed. For now I have included Procedure (default), hopsitals, and patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Part #3: Information on Patients Helped\n",
    "This information was also added to the dashboard in Task #1, showing per procedure, how many distinct patients were helped, as well as an overall number on the right side. Date filters are also included, enabling users to select a specific time frame based on the start and end dates of procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Part #4: Speciality-specific information\n",
    "On top of adding a procedure filter, we could also control what data each team member sees, based on their role. Tableau has functionalities to implement specific data access on data rows (called Row Level Security), which enables us to rely on one interface for all users, making it easier to maintain, while ensuring that noone sees data that they shouldn't see. Here, implementing a list of allowed users enabled to see Hospice treatments, and integrating it into the dashboard could ensure that only this group sees this very critical information."

Only senior management is allowed to see these visualisations, whereas other employees in the org are allowed to have access to the raw extracts. One visualization should be about the data of our clients, how many patients we have helped from specific areas. Possibly to identify any relationship between the area of residence and the preocedures that are being performed. The other graphs we would like to see are non-client related, we would like to see if there are any patients grouped together that are not affeliated to any of our clients, but are in close proximity of patients who are in contact with our clients."
